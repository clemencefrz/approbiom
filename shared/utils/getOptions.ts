/**
 * Builds the options of a MultiSelect from the rows it filters: reads one value
 * per row, drops the duplicates and keeps the first-seen order.
 *
 * @param rows     Rows the filter applies to, duplicates included.
 * @param getValue Reads the filtered value off a row.
 * @param getLabel Writes the value the way it should be read on screen. Left
 *                 out, the value is shown as the document stores it.
 *
 * @remark Rows whose value is empty are dropped — they would render a nameless
 * checkbox. A filter that has to offer them needs an option of its own, with a
 * label saying what an empty value means (see `getAppelAProjetOptions`).
