// Promotes staging to production: dist/staging/ -> dist/prod/
//
// This is a pure COPY, never a rebuild. Production therefore ships exactly
// the bytes that were validated in the staging Grist document. It works only
// because vite.config.js sets `base: './'`, which makes the built asset URLs
// relative and so independent of the path the widget is served from.
//
// The future GitHub Actions promotion job (workflow_dispatch) will do the
// same copy against the stored staging artifact.
